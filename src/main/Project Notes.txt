To make a new driving mode, 
 - Create a new java class under frc.robot.Lucas_Soliman.DriveModes, name the class corresponding to the mode you are creating
 - Implement the DriveMode Interface which is contained in the DriveMode.java file
 - Create a constructor that takes in an instance of RobotDrive.java
 - From there you can create code that will interface with the DifferentialDrive instance in the RobotDrive
